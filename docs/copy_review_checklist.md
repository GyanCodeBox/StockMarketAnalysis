# UX Copy Review Checklist: Cognitive Safety & Precision

All user-facing copy in TERMINAL.AI must adhere to these guidelines to ensure institutional neutrality and prevent misinterpretation by participants.

## 1. Directional Neutrality
- [ ] No mention of "Buy", "Sell", "Long", "Short", "Accumulate", or "Distribute" as advice.
- [ ] Replace "Buy Signal" with "Structural Alignment" or "Regime Entry".
- [ ] Replace "Sell Target" with "Structural Resistance" or "Historical Supply Zone".
- [ ] Avoid imperative verbs (e.g., "Exit now", "Entry triggered").

## 2. Predictive Restraint
- [ ] No claims of "Prediction", "Forecast", or "Target Price".
- [ ] Use "Projection", "Simulated Scenario", or "Current Trajectory".
- [ ] Phrases like "Will go up" or "Likely to crash" are strictly prohibited.
- [ ] Use probabilistic language: "Evidence suggests", "Structural bias favors", "Asymmetry identified".

## 3. Score Interpretation
- [ ] Frame scores (0-100) as "Relative Ranking" or "Quality Metrics".
- [ ] Explicitly state: "Score is a qualitative assessment of the regime, not an expected return."
- [ ] Ensure "Risk" is framed as "Monitoring Dimensionality" or "Constraint Analysis".

## 4. Glossary Alignment
- [ ] All technical terms must match the definitions in `docs/glossary.md`.
- [ ] Tooltips must provide both the definition and the "Explicitly Not" disclaimer where applicable.

## 5. Visual Safety
- [ ] Red colors must represent "Risk", "Deterioration", or "Supply dominance"—never just "Sell".
- [ ] Green colors must represent "Growth", "Quality", or "Absorption"—never just "Buy".
- [ ] Neutral states should be clearly marked and explained as "transitional" or "data-insufficient".
