# TERMINAL.AI Glossary of Institutional Terminology

This document serves as the single source of truth for all analytical concepts within TERMINAL.AI.

## Market Structure (Technical)

| Term | Definition | Explicitly Not |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accumulation** | Evidence of sustained absorption of supply by large participants within a compressed price range. Indicates a potential structural base. | A "Buy" signal. Price can remain in accumulation for extended periods or fail. |
| **Distribution** | Evidence of supply dominance and institutional selling following a sustained price advance. | A "Sell" signal. Distribution can be complex and involve multiple re-tests of highs. |
| **Failed Breakout** | A price move outside a structural zone that fails to hold and returns inside, often trapping participants on the wrong side. | A reversal guarantee. It is a marker of trapped liquidity. |
| **Technical Regime** | The current structural bias (Accumulation, Distribution, or Neutral) based on price-volume relationship and area of interest. | A trend-following indicator only. Structure evaluates the *context* of the trend. |

## Fundamental Analysis

| Term | Definition | Explicitly Not |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Growth Quality** | The consistency and underlying drivers of revenue and earnings expansion. | Revenue magnitude. High growth with low quality (e.g. margin squeeze) is flagged. |
| **Capital Efficiency** | How effectively the business converts capital (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) into operating profit (ROCE). | Stock price performance. |
| **Regime Diagnostic** | A narrative assessment of the current fundamental phase (Growth, Compression, Deterioration, Maturity). | A recommendation. It is a description of business reality. |
| **Other Income Ratio** | The percentage of Net Income derived from non-operating activities (investments, one-offs). | Operating success. High ratios are flagged as "Distortions". |

## Decision Intelligence (Confluence)

| Term | Definition | Explicitly Not |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Confluence** | The state of alignment (or misalignment) between the Technical Structure and Fundamental Reality. | A directional conviction score. It measures "Asymmetry". |
| **Composite Score** | A relative regime quality score (0-100) combining technical strength, fundamental grade, and regime stability. | An expected return or price target. |
| **Regime Stability** | The persistence and historical consistency of the current analytical state. Higher stability implies lower noise. | A safety guarantee. Stable regimes can still shift abruptly. |
| **Risk Constraint** | Structural or fundamental factors identified as potential points of failure or headwinds for the current regime. | A "Red Flag" or prediction of a crash. |

## Portfolio Monitoring

| Term | Definition | Explicitly Not |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Attention Flag** | A system-generated priority level (Stable, Monitor, Review, Critical) to guide daily monitoring workflow. | An indicator of transaction urgency or timing. |
| **Prioritization** | The process of using quantitative filters to decide which instruments require clinical deep-dive analysis. | A signal generation engine. |
